           <p><strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong> is someone you want to stay away
              from. You always talk about value picks, yet Mahomes is the number
              one projected QB and is sure to regress from last year. Not only
              do the Chiefs have to play one of the toughest schedules in this
              league in 2019, but Mahomes will have less talented weapons at his
              disposal. Tyreek Hill is sure to miss many games and Damien
              Williams/Carlos Hyde won't be able to make up for Kareem Hunt's
              unique talent he displayed before being released from the team
              last year.</p>
           <p>Which brings me to <strong>Mecole Hardman</strong>. Although
              Hardman isn't even close to the player Tyreek Hill is (or rather
              was), there will be plenty of opportunity for him to to soak up a
              good chunk of Hill's targets, being that he has the same playing
              style and that Mahomes will continue to spread the ball around in
              Andy Reid's <em>impressive</em> aerial attack. You can read more
